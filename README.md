# What causes obesity?
Trying to understand obesity by looking at statistics.

Obesity is a problem in the province I live in and I thought it would be interesting trying to figure out what makes my province more different than other provinces. I have by no means come to a conclusion so far, but we can at least see some type of increasing relation between obesity and unemployment.
