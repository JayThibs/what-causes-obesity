# What causes obesity?
Trying to understand obesity by looking at statistics.

Obesity is a problem in the province I live in and I thought it would be interesting trying to figure out what makes my province's population more susceptible to obesity than other provinces. I have by no means come to a conclusion so far, but we can at least see some type of increasing relation between obesity and unemployment.

Figure 1: A linear fit is made with data on obesity and unemployment averages from Stats Canada. Each point is contains the percentage of obesity and unemployment of a particular province or territory.

This obviously does not mean that unemployment causes obesity, there are an enormous amount of factors that could give us a similar result. This is just a start. Depending if I find it worth my time, I will try to make sense of all the statistics to come to a solid conclusion.
